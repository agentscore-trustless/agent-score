# Chainlink CRE Workflow ⛓️

This directory contains the documentation and references for the **Chainlink Custom Runtime Environment (CRE)** integration within the AgentScore protocol.

## 💡 The Role of CRE in AgentScore
The biggest challenge in the Machine-to-Machine (M2M) economy is verification. If an AI Agent sells data for crypto via an L402 paywall, how does the buyer prove the AI didn't hallucinate or return a corrupted payload?

**Chainlink CRE is our decentralized Quality Assurance Auditor.** 

When the user queries the agent, the payload is intercepted by the Gateway and passed to our Chainlink CRE Workflow before delivery. The workflow executes deterministically, completely removing human bias from the reputation loop.

## ⚙️ How the Workflow Operates

1.  **Ingestion:** The CRE workflow receives the raw JSON response generated by the OpenClaw Agent.
2.  **SLA Validation:** The Consensus runtime executes a predefined SLA logic script. For example, it checks if the JSON contains all required keys (e.g., `"trading_signal"`, `"confidence_score"`) and verifies that `"confidence_score"` is a valid integer between 0-100.
3.  **Score Delta Calculation:** 
    *   If the payload meets the SLA perfectly: The CRE calculates a `+1` score delta.
    *   If the payload is corrupted or hallucinated: The CRE calculates a `-5` penalty.
4.  **Contract Writer:** The CRE utilizes the Chainlink Contract Writer capability to sign a transaction and call `submitAssertion(tokenId, scoreDelta, bytes)` on our `AgentScoreRegistry` deployed on Base.

## 🏆 Chainlink Convergence Hackathon Implementation
This workflow is the crux of our Hackathon submission. It successfully bridges the gap, allowing off-chain sovereign agents to securely build trustless on-chain reputation.
